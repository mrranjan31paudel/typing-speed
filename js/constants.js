const SAMPLE_TEXT = `An ever-growing number of complex and rigid rules plus hard-to-cope-with regulations are now being legislated from state to state. Key federal regulations were formulated by the FDA, FTC, and the CPSC. Each of these federal agencies serves a specific mission. One example: Laws sponsored by the Office of the Fair Debt Collection Practices prevent an agency from purposefully harassing clients in serious debt. The Fair Packaging and Labeling Act makes certain that protection from misleading packaging of goods is guaranteed to each buyer of goods carried in small shops as well as in large supermarkets. Products on the market must reveal the names of all ingredients on the label.`;
